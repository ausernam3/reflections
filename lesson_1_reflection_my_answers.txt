How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    volume of code to search was reduced to only the changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Clearer oversight of the 'whole picture'

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: Choosing when to create a new version allows for cognitive 'grouping' of changes into more easily undersandable bundles

    con: no 'auto save' .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    VCS commits record information about the relatonships between collections of files. This allows for cognitive 'grouping' of changes into more easily undesandeable bundles

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat shows filename with number of insertions and deletions
    git diff xxx yyy shows the diff between earlier version xxx and later version yyy 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can be confident that I can easily revert to a previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    setting up a Git Server! ;-)
