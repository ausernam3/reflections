When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If you want to be able to access the contents remotely, e.g roadwarrior or share outside your immediate organisation.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	clone makes a local copy of a repo
	
	fork is a verb provided by github.com. It copies a repo on github to a a new separate copy on github.com

	a branch is adding a new node as a 'side branch' to an existing dependency tree hierarchy in a repo.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can see the latest checked in additions without having a live internet connection e.g. on a plane

	You can merge the recent remote updates into YOUR local master to update your local master to latest, without having to add your local experimental changes into the remote repo.
